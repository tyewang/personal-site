  <h1>Hi, friends! I have a new app that I want to get some feedback on.</h1>

  <p>
  Have you ever passed by a place that you've never seen before, and it looks awesome?<br/>And you swear to yourself that you'll look it up later, only to forget its name 20 minutes later?<br/><br/>This shit happens to me ALL THE TIME. That's why I built this app.

  <p>
  The Quick Add app (real name tbd) shows you all the places that are closest to you right now. With a single tap, you can save those places.

    What I need from you
  </h2>
  <p>
  Just use the app! I want to find out if this is a common use case for people and if this idea is actually useful. As always, DM me if you have any feedback :)

    How is this related to Nombler?
  </h3>
  <p>
  If there's actually a use case for this, in the future this will be integrated into www.nombler.com. That way, you can move/save your quick added places into your Nombler maps.
